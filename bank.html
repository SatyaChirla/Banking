        <h4>Personal loan</h4>
        <p> 
            Most of us tend turn to our friends and family when we need money urgently. We may not like it, but we do it because we believe we hardly have any other choice. But borrowing money from friends and family can put a strain on our personal relationships and put you in an awkward position of obligation, especially if we are unable to repay the loan amount on time. Some of us also borrow from money-lenders who may charge us a high interest rate along with collateral. If you can identify with any of these scenarios, it is time to consider taking out a Personal Loan to repay your debt. There are several benefits of doing so.
You can pay back the loan in affordable EMIs: Personal Loans are one of the best products offered by banks. They are often unsecured in nature i.e. you do not have to provide any collateral against the loan. The loan amount is typically sanctioned and disbursed in a just a couple of days. There is also no restriction on how you choose to use your loan amount, so long as you repay it. You can repay the Personal Loan in affordable EMIs, by selecting a tenure that suits you. Banks generally offer a minimum tenure of 1 year and a maximum tenure of 5 years for loan repayment.
